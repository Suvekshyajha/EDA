# EDA
This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets to understand data structure, distributions, missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables. The goal is to extract insights, identify patterns, and prepare datasets for effective data-driven decision making.


📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Overview

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on different datasets to understand data structure, distributions, missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables. The goal is to extract insights and prepare data for further analysis or modeling.

Currently, the repository includes EDA on the Titanic dataset.

🚢 Dataset Used

Titanic Dataset

Contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status

Commonly used for learning data analysis and feature understanding

🔍 EDA Steps Performed

Data loading and inspection

Understanding dataset shape and data types

Missing value analysis

Univariate analysis (distributions, counts)

Bivariate analysis (relationships with target variable)

Outlier detection

Basic visualizations for insights

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📈 Key Insights (Titanic Dataset)

Survival rate differs significantly by gender and passenger class

Age and fare show skewed distributions

Missing values are prominent in age and cabin-related features
